        This specification defines a mechanism to bundle an arbitrary set of resources into a single
        Zip archive and for the page that references the bundle to then address the resources 
        directly. This makes it possible to greatly reduce the number of network requests that a
        document will make. Care has been taken to ensure that this approach is backwards compatible
        with existing user agents, and easy to use for authors.
